But this should not happen if you were led to think these pairings would occur in the future. Importantly, you should know that faces of the blue and yellow group were always equally often presented with pleasant and unpleasant pictures. In this study, we wanted to target your belief (that this was the case) and not the actual pairing. <br><br>";
